The Ancient Altar is a block in the [Magical Gadgets](Magical-Gadgets.md) category, as well as a Multiblock structure.  
It is used to craft other [Magical Items](../Magical-Items/Magical-Items.md) and gadgets, and to repair [Broken Spawners](../Magical-Items/Broken-Spawner.md) so they become [Reinforced Spawners](Reinforced-Spawner.md).

## 取得

The Ancient Altar block can be crafted in a [Magic Workbench](../Basic-Machines/Magic-Workbench.md).

## 使用方法

The Ancient Altar block on its own has no use. In order to have a working altar, the Ancient Altar must be surrounded by 8 [Ancient Pedestals](Ancient-Pedestal.md), 2 blocks away from it in cardinal directions and 1 block away diagonally.

A working Ancient Altar looks like this:

To begin the crafting process or "ritual", each ingredient in the recipe must be placed on the pedestals by right-clicking them.  
The item in the middle of the recipe (or "catalyst") must then be used on the central altar block.

It does not matter on which axis (diagonal or horizontal/vertical) the ingredients are placed, as long as they are in the right order.

If the recipe is correct, the catalyst will be consumed. Then, after a short animation, the Ancient Altar will expel the new item.
