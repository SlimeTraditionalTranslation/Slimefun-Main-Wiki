The Auto Enchanter is an [Electric Machine](../Electric-Machines.md) which can be used to add Enchanted Books to tools and weapons.  
It will then return empty books without enchants and the enchanted piece.

## Auto Enchanter Tiers

There are 2 tiers of the Auto Enchanter and they have the following properties:

| 等級 | 能量     | 緩衝     | Speed |
| -- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| I  | 18 J/s | 128 J  | 1.0 x |
| II | 48 J/s | 1028 J | 3.0 x |

## Tip

Together with the [Auto Disenchanter](Auto-Disenchanter.md) you can use this to disenchant [Reinforced Armor](../../Armor/Armor.md#reinforced-armor) to obtain Protection IX and Unbreaking IX books and put those on diamond or netherite gear.
