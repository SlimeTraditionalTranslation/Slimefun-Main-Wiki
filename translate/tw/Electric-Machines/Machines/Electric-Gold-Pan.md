The Electric Gold Pan is an [Electric Machine](../Electric-Machines.md) which obtains [Sifted Ore](../../Miscellaneous-Items/Sifted-Ore.md) from gravel, just like the [Gold Pan](../../Tools/Gold-Pan.md) and the [Automated Panning Machine](../../Basic-Machines/Automated-Panning-Machine.md).

Unlike the [Electric Dust Washer](Electric-Dust-Washer.md) it still produces by-products and thus the yield rate is exactly the same as its non-electric variants.
