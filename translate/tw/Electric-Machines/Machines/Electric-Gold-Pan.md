The Electric Gold Pan is an [Electric Machine](Electric-Machines) which obtains [Sifted Ore](Sifted-Ore) from gravel, just like the [Gold Pan](Gold-Pan) and the [Automated Panning Machine](Automated-Panning-Machine).

Unlike the [Electric Dust Washer](Electric-Dust-Washer) it still produces by-products and thus the yield rate is exactly the same as its non-electric variants.
