The Electric Smeltery is an [Electric Machine](../Electric-Machines.md) which creates [Alloys](../../Resources/Ingots/Ingots.md#alloys) from [Ingots](../../Resources/Ingots/Ingots.md).  
If you want to smelt [Dusts](../../Resources/Dusts/Dusts.md) into [Ingots](../../Resources/Ingots/Ingots.md), take a look at the [Electric Ingot Factory](Electric-Ingot-Factory.md).

It is the automated version of the [Smeltery](../../Basic-Machines/Smeltery.md).
