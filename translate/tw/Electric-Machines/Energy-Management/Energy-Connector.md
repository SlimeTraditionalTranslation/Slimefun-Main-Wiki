The Energy Connector is an [Electric Component](Electric-Machines) which can transfer energy in an Energy Network. Unlike an [Energy Capacitor](Energy-Capacitors), it has no buffer.

## 使用方法

An energy capacitor must be placed within 7 blocks of an [Electric Machine](Electric-Machines#Machines), [Energy Generator](Electric-Machines#Energy-generation), [Energy Regulator](Energy-Regulator), or another capacitor (in a straight line; no diagonals).

They transfer energy between blocks in that range, so they can be used to extend your network.
