The Combustion Reactor is a type of [Energy Generator](Electric-Machines#energy-generation).

## Obtaining

A Combustion Reactor can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage

A Combustion Reactor must be placed within 7 blocks of an [Energy Regulator](Energy-Regulator), an [Energy Connector](Energy-Connector), or an [Energy Capacitor](Energy-Capacitors) in a cross format (not diagonally), and provided with the appropriate fuel.

Once it is placed, right-click it and place fuel in its inventory (two slots on the left).

## Tiers

There is only one tier of the Combustion Reactor.

| Tier | Energy | Buffer |
|:----:|:------:|:------:|
|  I   | 24 J/s | 256 J  |

## 燃料

This generator can be fueled using Buckets of Oil and Buckets of Fuel.

| 燃料             | Burning time | Total (Tier I) |
|:-------------- |:------------:|:--------------:|
| Bucket of Oil  |     30s      |     720 J      |
| Bucket of Fuel |     90s      |    2.16 kJ     |

Note that it is more efficient to turn your Buckets of Oil into Buckets of Fuel in a [Refinery](Refinery) before burning them as fuel.
