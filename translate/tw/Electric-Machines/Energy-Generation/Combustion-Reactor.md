The Combustion Reactor is a type of [Energy Generator](../Electric-Machines.md#energy-generation).

## 取得

A Combustion Reactor can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](../../Basic-Machines/Enhanced-Crafting-Table.md).

## 使用方法

A Combustion Reactor must be placed within 7 blocks of an [Energy Regulator](../Energy-Management/Energy-Regulator.md), an [Energy Connector](../Energy-Management/Energy-Connector.md), or an [Energy Capacitor](../Energy-Management/Energy-Capacitors.md) in a cross format (not diagonally), and provided with the appropriate fuel.

Once it is placed, right-click it and place fuel in its inventory (two slots on the left).

## 等級

There is only one tier of the Combustion Reactor.

| 等級 |   能量   |  緩衝   |
|:--:|:------:|:-----:|
| I  | 24 J/s | 256 J |

## 燃料

This generator can be fueled using Buckets of Oil and Buckets of Fuel.

| 燃料             | 燃燒時間 | Total (Tier I) |
|:-------------- |:----:|:--------------:|
| Bucket of Oil  | 30s  |     720 J      |
| Bucket of Fuel | 90s  |    2.16 kJ     |

Note that it is more efficient to turn your Buckets of Oil into Buckets of Fuel in a [Refinery](../Machines/Refinery.md) before burning them as fuel.
