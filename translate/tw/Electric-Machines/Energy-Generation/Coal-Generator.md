The Coal Generator is a type of [Energy Generator](Electric-Machines#energy-generation).

## Obtaining

All tiers of coal generators can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage

A coal generator must be placed within 7 blocks of an [Energy Regulator](Energy-Regulator), an [Energy Connector](Energy-Connector), or an [Energy Capacitor](Energy-Capacitors) in a cross format (not diagonally), and provided with the appropriate fuel.

## Tiers

There are currently two tiers of coal generators.

| Tier | Energy | Buffer |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| I    | 16 J/s | 64 J   |
| II   | 30 J/s | 256 J  |

## 燃料

Despite being a "coal" generator, this generator can also be fueled with blaze rods, wood logs, planks and other wooden items.

Note that it is twice as efficient to turn your logs into planks in a [Table Saw](Table-Saw) before burning them as fuel.
