title: Electric Machines Overview
---

The Energy and Electricity category adds various machines which generate, consume or transfer energy (measured in Joules or J). It also includes [Programmable Androids](Androids), which can be programmed to execute a series of tasks.

Besides a way to generate electricity for your machines, an energy network requires an [Energy Regulator](Energy-Regulator): without it, power transfer cannot happen.  
You may also want to use [Energy Capacitors](Energy-Capacitors), as they can store excess energy and extend the range of your network. The [Energy Connector](Energy-Connector) can also extend your network, but it does not store power.

Some machines have a buffer, meaning they can store a certain amount of energy. Unlike capacitors, however, if the energy isn't used before it reaches maximum capacity, it will be reset entirely.

Electric machines are best used with a [Cargo Management System](Cargo-Management) for automatic item transportation.

For more information on the individual items in this category, see the table of contents below.
