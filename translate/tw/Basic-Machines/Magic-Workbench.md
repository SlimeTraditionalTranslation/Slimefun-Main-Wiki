It is used to craft many [Magical Items](Magical-Items) and [Magical Gadgets](Magical-Gadgets).

Check out the Magical Workbench in the Slimefun Guide in-game for all possible recipes.

To craft items in the Magic Workbench, you put the correct recipe in the dispenser then right click the crafting table and if the recipe was correct, it'll output your item.
