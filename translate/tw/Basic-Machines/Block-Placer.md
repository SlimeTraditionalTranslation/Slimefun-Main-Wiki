The Block-Placer is a part of the [Basic Machines](/docs/Slimefun/Basic-Machines) category. It is a craftable item which places the placeable blocks present in the dispenser.

## Obtaining

The Block-Placer can be crafted using the [Enchanted Crafting Table](Enhanced-Crafting-Table). A crafted Block placer looks like the following: ![Block Placer Showcase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Slimefun/Slimefun-Wiki/master/images/block-placer-showcase.png)

## 使用方法

The Block-Placer can place any placeable block or object in the face of the dispenser. It cannot function as a dispenser or dropper, i.e. it cannot dispense or drop objects.

You can place the block placer just like you do for any other dispenser or dropper. ![Block Placer Placed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Slimefun/Slimefun-Wiki/master/images/block-placer-placed.png)

The powering circuit is simply with redstone (just like dispensers or droppers). And it places a random block from its inventory on the face of the dispenser on the rising edge of the redstone signal. ![Block Placer Powering](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Slimefun/Slimefun-Wiki/master/images/block-placer-powering.png)

It will only place the blocks which are placeable and ignore all dispenseable items. ![Block Placer Placing Blocks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Slimefun/Slimefun-Wiki/master/images/block-placer-placing.png)
