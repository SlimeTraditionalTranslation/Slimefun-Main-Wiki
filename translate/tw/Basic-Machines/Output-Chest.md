An Output Chest is a [Basic Machine](/docs/Slimefun/Basic-Machines) in Slimefun.

It is a chest which, when placed adjacent to the Dispenser part of a Basic Machine, collects any items crafted with it.

It can also be placed next to the Stonecutter in a [Table Saw](Table-Saw), or the Cauldron in an [Automated Panning Machine](Automated-Panning-Machine).
