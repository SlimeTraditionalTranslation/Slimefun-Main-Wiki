The Automatic Ignition Chamber is part of the [Basic Machines](/docs/Slimefun/Basic-Machines) category.

## 使用方法

The Automatic Ignition Chamber can only be used as an extension on the [Smeltery](Smeltery) (not the Makeshift Smeltery).  
You just put it next to the dispenser of the smeltery and fill it with flint and steel, and it will keep the fire under the smeltery lit up.
