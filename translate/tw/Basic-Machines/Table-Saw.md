鋸木機是一個非常簡單的[機器](/docs/Slimefun/Basic-Machines).

You can use it to turn logs into 8 planks instead of the normal 4 you would get when using a Crafting Table.

該配方可以在你的 Slimefun 指南中找到，但這是最終版本：

You can also place an [Output Chest](Output-Chest) next to the Stonecutter to catch your crafted Items. Otherwise your planks will be dropped on top of the Stonecutter.

## How to use the Table Saw

Hold a piece of log in your hand and right-click the Stonecutter.

Note that the Table Saw supports all types of logs, including Stripped variants and barks.
