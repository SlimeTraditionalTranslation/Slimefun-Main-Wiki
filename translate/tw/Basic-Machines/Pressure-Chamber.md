You can also place an [Output Chest](Output-Chest) next to the dispenser to collect your items. If there is no [Output Chest](Output-Chest), then it will be put in the dispenser.

## Usage

The Pressure Chamber is used to put pressure on items, check out the Pressure Chamber in the Slimefun Guide in-game for more recipes.

To use the Pressure Chamber, put the items (with the correct pattern) in the dispenser and your items will be output when you right click the cauldron.
