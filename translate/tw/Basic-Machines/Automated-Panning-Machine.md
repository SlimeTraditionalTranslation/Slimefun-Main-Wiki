It's an automated version of the [Gold Pan](Gold-Pan) and the [Nether Gold Pan](Nether-Gold-Pan).

You can also place an [Output Chest](Output-Chest) next to the cauldron to collect your items. If there is no [Output Chest](Output-Chest), then it will be thrown on top of the trapdoor.

## 使用方法

It's a faster version of the [Gold Pan](Gold-Pan) and the [Nether Gold Pan](Nether-Gold-Pan) and has the exact same usages as them combined.

To use the Automated Panning Machine, right click trapdoor with any block that is convertable, it will then proceed to output its converted items after a small animation.
