Among the [Weapons](/docs/Slimefun/Weapons) it adds, Slimefun introduces three new bows: the Soulbound Bow, the Explosive Bow, and the Icy Bow.

They each have special properties and may be enchanted like any other Bow.

## Soulbound Bow

The Soulbound Bow remains in your inventory upon death.

*See also: [Soulbound Weapons](Soulbound-Weapons)*

## Explosive Bow

Arrows fired by the Explosive Bow launch the Player or Mob they hit into the air.

## Icy Bow

Arrows fired by the Icy Bow prevent the Player or Mob they hit from moving for 2 seconds. They will be immune to freezing for 5 seconds afterwards.
