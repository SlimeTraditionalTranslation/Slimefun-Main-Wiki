The Pickaxe of the Seeker is an item in the [tools](Tools) category.

It is an unenchanted diamond pickaxe which can help you locate nearby ore.

## Obtaining

The Pickaxe of the Seeker can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## 使用方法

When you right-click with the pickaxe in your main hand, it forces you to look in the direction of the closest ore block in a 4 block radius.

However, using this ability consumes durability, even if no ore is found nearby, so use it carefully.
