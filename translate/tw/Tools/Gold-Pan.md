The Gold Pan is a very important item that is part of the [Tools](Tools) category. There are two variants, the normal Gold Pan and the [Nether Gold Pan](Nether-Gold-Pan).

This page will only cover the standard Gold Pan.

## How to use the Gold Pan

You right-click a block of gravel while holding a Gold Pan in your main hand.

The block will break and drop Flint, Clay, [Sifted Ore](Sifted-Ore) or an Iron Nugget.

You can read more about [Sifted Ore](Sifted-Ore) and how to use it in Slimefun's ["Getting Started" Guide](Getting-Started).

## Drop chances

Each item you can get with a Gold Pan has a different probability to drop, listed below.

| Item                     | Chance |
| ------------------------ | ------ |
| Flint                    | 40%    |
| [Sifted Ore](Sifted-Ore) | 35%    |
| Clay                     | 20%    |
| Iron Nugget              | 5%     |
