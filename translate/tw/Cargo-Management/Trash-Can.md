A Trash Can is a container that destroys any item placed in it, much like the [Portable Dustbin](../Items/Portable-Dustbin.md).  
Unlike its portable equivalent, it must be placed down before it can be used, and it is fully compatible with cargo nodes, making it easy to destroy any unwanted items in a [Cargo Network](Cargo-Management.md).

## 取得

A trash can can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](../Basic-Machines/Enhanced-Crafting-Table.md).

## 使用方法

放置垃圾桶後右鍵點擊會顯示一個類似箱子的界面，可以在其中移動物品。  
物品放入垃圾桶後很快就會消失，不像便攜式垃圾箱會等待界面關閉再消失。

You can move items into a trash can manually, but it is also able to receive items through an [Output Node](Output-Node.md) or an [Advanced Output Nodes](Advanced-Output-Node.md).
