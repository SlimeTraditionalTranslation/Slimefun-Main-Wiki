Cargo Management is Slimefun's item transportation system.

With it, you can quickly and automatically move items between containers or [machines](Electric-Machines) over virtually any distance.

A cargo management network requires a [cargo manager](Cargo-Manager). It allows items to be transported and gives you information about your network. It allows items to be transported and gives you information about your network.

Placing [input](Input-Node) and [output nodes](Output-Node) on a container or machine allows the items in it to enter or exit the network, respectively. These nodes have to be in the direct range of a cargo manager, or they can be connected to one with [connector nodes](Connector-Node). These nodes have to be in the direct range of a cargo manager, or they can be connected to one with [connector nodes](Connector-Node).

Items in a cargo network are transported over a maximum of 16 separate channels, each labelled with a different color of wool.
