Slimefun adds 11 new Gold Ingots to the game.

They are differentiated by their purity (measured in "carats"), with the lowest purity being 4 and the highest being 24.

## Obtaining

Smelting [Gold Dust](Gold-Dust) in a [Smeltery](Smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](Electric-Ingot-Factory) produces a 4-carat Gold Ingot.

Higher purity gold is obtained by smelting any carat gold along with a piece of [Gold Dust](Gold-Dust). This "adds" 2 carats, up until 24-carat gold, thus 11 [Gold Dust](Gold-Dust) are needed to create a single 24-carat Gold Ingot.
