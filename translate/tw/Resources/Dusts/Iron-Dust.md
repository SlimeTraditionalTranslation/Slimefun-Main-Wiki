Iron Dust is one of the nine [dusts](/docs/Slimefun/Resources/Dusts) added in Slimefun.

## Obtaining

Crushing Iron Ore in an [Ore Crusher](Ore-Crusher) or an [Electric Ore Grinder](Electric-Ore-Grinder) yields two pieces of Iron Dust, effectively doubling it.

If you are using the [SlimefunOreChunks](Addons#official-addons) addon, you can use the same machines to turn Iron Ore Chunks from the [GEO Miner](GEO-Miner) into Iron Dust.

Iron Dust has a ~11.11% chance of being extracted from [Sifted Ore](Sifted-Ore), by processing it through an [Ore Washer](Ore-Washer) or an [Electric Dust Washer](Electric-Dust-Washer).

Additionally, crushing an [Iron Ingot](Iron-Ingot) in an [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](Electric-Ingot-Pulverizer) produces one piece of Iron Dust.

## Usage

Iron Dust can be smelted into [Iron Ingots](Iron-Ingot) in a [Smeltery](Smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](Electric-Ingot-Factory).

It is also used in the following [alloys](Ingots#Alloys) for the [Smeltery](Smeltery) or the [Electric Smeltery](Electric-Smeltery):

* [Steel Ingot](Steel-Ingot)
* [Damascus Steel Ingot](Damascus-Steel-Ingot)
* [Ferrosilicon](Ferrosilicon)
* [Gilded Iron](Gilded-Iron)
* [Nickel Ingot](Nickel-Ingot)
* [Cobalt Ingot](Cobalt-Ingot)

... and directly in creating other items:

* [Magnet](Magnet)

Iron is one of the most used dusts in Slimefun recipes, either as dust or as [Iron Ingot](Iron-Ingot).
