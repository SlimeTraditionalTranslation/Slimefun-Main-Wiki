Gold Dust is one of the nine [dusts](/docs/Slimefun/Resources/Dusts) added in Slimefun.

## Obtaining

- Crushing Gold Ore in an [Ore Crusher](Ore-Crusher) or an [Electric Ore Grinder](Electric-Ore-Grinder) yields two pieces of Gold Dust.

- Gold Dust has a ~11.11% chance of being extracted from [Sifted Ore](Sifted-Ore), by processing it through an [Ore Washer](Ore-Washer) or an [Electric Dust Washer](Electric-Dust-Washer).
- Crushing a [4-carat Gold Ingot](Gold-Ingot#Gold-Ingot-4-Carat)  or a normal Gold Ingot in an [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](Electric-Ingot-Pulverizer) produces one piece of Gold Dust.
- If you are using the [SlimefunOreChunks](Addons#official-addons) addon, you can use the same machines to turn Gold Ore Chunks from the [GEO Miner](GEO-Miner) into Gold Dust.

## 使用方法

Gold Dust can be smelted into [4-carat to 24-carat Gold Ingots](Gold-Ingot) in a [Smeltery](Smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](Electric-Ingot-Factory).

It is also used in the [Corinthian Bronze Ingot](Corinthian-Bronze-Ingot) [alloy](Ingots#Alloys), which can be made in a [Smeltery](Smeltery) or an [Electric Smeltery](Electric-Smeltery).

Gold is one of the most used dusts in Slimefun recipes, either as dust or as [Gold Ingot](Gold-Ingot).
