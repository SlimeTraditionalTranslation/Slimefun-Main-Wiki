Uranium is a [Resource](/docs/Slimefun/Resources) that can be used to power [Nuclear Reactors](Electric-Machines#energy-generation) or to create even better radioactive fuels.

## Obtaining

Uranium can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](Enhanced-Crafting-Table) using 4 [Small Chunks of Uranium](Miscellaneous-Items).

## Handling

Uranium is MODERATELY [Radioactive](Radiation). Blistering Ingots are HIGHLY [Radioactive](Radiation). Wearing a [Hazmat Suit](Armor#hazmat-suit) at all times while handling them is *highly recommended*.
