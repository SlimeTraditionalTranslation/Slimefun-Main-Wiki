Broken Spawners are an item in the [Magical Items](Magical-Items.md) category.

As the name implies, they do not function in this state.

## 取得

A Broken Spawner can be acquired by destroying a vanilla spawner with a [Pickaxe of Containment](../Tools/Pickaxe-of-Containment.md). The mob type will be the same as the original, working spawner.

## 使用方法

A Broken Spawner does not work and cannot be placed. However, it can be [repaired](../Magical-Gadgets/Reinforced-Spawner.md) by performing the correct ritual (found in your Slimefun guide) at an [Ancient Altar](../Magical-Gadgets/Ancient-Altar.md).
