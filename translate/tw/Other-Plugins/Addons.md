## :trophy: 附加果醬比賽

In 2020 we started hosting our very first "Slimefun Addon Jam" on our discord server.

We hope to make this a re-occurring thing. The basic premise is the following: At the start of the Jam we will announce a theme and every developer has a limited time frame to create a Slimefun Addon - from scratch - based on that theme. When the Jam has ended we will review their submissions, rate them and hand out prizes to the addons that performed the best.

Here is a list of all Addon Jams that have been hosted so far:

1. [Addon Jam 2020](Addon-Jam-2020)
2. [Addon Jam 2021](Addon-Jam-2021)

## :black_nib: 製作屬於自己的附加!

Do you want to create your own Slimefun Addon? Check out this [Developer Guide](Developer-Guide).

If you have made an Addon for Slimefun and want it to be listed on here, simply make a new pull request on our wiki repository. You can find a tutorial here: Expanding-the-Wiki.  
If a pull request is not possible, then just create an Issue and select the "Addition" template:
