Welcome to our Developer Guide!

This page is still under construction, as this is a huge topic and will most likely take a long time to complete.

Anyway, let's get started!

## 先決條件

We will try to target a wide range of developers, even ones with less experience.

However, we do not want to reinvent the wheel, there are already a lot of extensive tutorials on how to learn Java or how to create bukkit plugins.

We will assume you to be familiar with the basics of Java, Maven, Git and the concepts of Object-orientation.

If these words all sound unfamiliar to you, then please read up on these and come back later.

We will do our best to try to explain as much as we can though, but please read these pages thoroughly.

You can of course also always questions on our Discord Server in the channel `#programming-help`.

You can click on the discord badge at the bottom of the page to join.

You can also check out our [Javadocs](https://slimefun.github.io/javadocs/Slimefun4/docs/) to get some more technical information about how the API is structured. But we would advise you to check this guide first.
