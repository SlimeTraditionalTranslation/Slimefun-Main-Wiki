The Lava Generator is a type of [Energy Generator](../Electric-Machines.md#energy-generation).

## Obtaining

All tiers of lava generators can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](../../Basic-Machines/Enhanced-Crafting-Table.md).

## Usage

A lava generator must be placed within 7 blocks of an [Energy Regulator](../Energy-Management/Energy-Regulator.md), an [Energy Connector](../Energy-Management/Energy-Connector.md), or an [Energy Capacitor](../Energy-Management/Energy-Capacitors.md) in a cross format (not diagonally), and provided with the appropriate fuel.  

## Tiers

There are currently two tiers of lava generators.

| Tier | Energy | Buffer |
| :--: | :----: | :----: |
| I    | 20 J/s | 512 J  |
| II   | 40 J/s | 1024 J |

## Fuel

This generator can only be fueled with lava buckets.

| Fuel        | Burning time | Total (Tier I) | Total (Tier II) |
| :---------- | :----------: | :------------: | :-------------: |
| Lava Bucket | 40s          | 800 J          | 1.6 kJ          |
