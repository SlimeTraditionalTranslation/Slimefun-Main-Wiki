title: Electric Machines Overview
---

The Energy and Electricity category adds various machines which generate, consume or transfer energy (measured in Joules or J). It also includes [Programmable Androids](../Technical-Components/Androids/Androids.md), which can be programmed to execute a series of tasks.

Besides a way to generate electricity for your machines, an energy network requires an [Energy Regulator](./Energy-Management/Energy-Regulator.md): without it, power transfer cannot happen.  
You may also want to use [Energy Capacitors](./Energy-Management/Energy-Capacitors.md), as they can store excess energy and extend the range of your network. The [Energy Connector](./Energy-Management/Energy-Connector.md) can also extend your network, but it does not store power.

Some machines have a buffer, meaning they can store a certain amount of energy. Unlike capacitors, however, if the energy isn't used before it reaches maximum capacity, it will be reset entirely.

Electric machines are best used with a [Cargo Management System](../Cargo-Management/Cargo-Management.md) for automatic item transportation.
