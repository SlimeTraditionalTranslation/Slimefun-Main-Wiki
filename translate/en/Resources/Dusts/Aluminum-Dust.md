## Usage

Aluminum Dust can be smelted into [Aluminum Ingots](Aluminum-Ingot) in a [Smeltery](Smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](Electric-Ingot-Factory).

It is also used in the following [alloys](Ingots#Alloys) for the [Smeltery](Smeltery) or the [Electric Smeltery](Electric-Smeltery):

* [Aluminum Brass Ingot](Aluminum-Brass-Ingot)

... and directly in creating other items:
