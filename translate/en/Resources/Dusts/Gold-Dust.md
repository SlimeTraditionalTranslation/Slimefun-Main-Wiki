Gold Dust is one of the nine [dusts](Dusts.md) added in Slimefun.

## Obtaining

- Crushing Raw Gold in an [Ore Crusher](../../Basic-Machines/Ore-Crusher.md) or an [Electric Ore Grinder](../../Electric-Machines/Machines/Electric-Ore-Grinder.md) yields one piece of Gold Dust.
- Crushing Gold Ore in an [Ore Crusher](../../Basic-Machines/Ore-Crusher.md) or an [Electric Ore Grinder](../../Electric-Machines/Machines/Electric-Ore-Grinder.md) yields two pieces of Gold Dust, effectively doubling it.
- Gold Dust has a ~11.11% chance of being extracted from [Sifted Ore](../../Miscellaneous-Items/Sifted-Ore.md), by processing it through an [Ore Washer](../../Basic-Machines/Ore-Washer.md) or an [Electric Dust Washer](../../Electric-Machines/Machines/Electric-Dust-Washer.md).
- Crushing a [4-carat Gold Ingot](../../Resources/Ingots/Metals/Gold-Ingot.md#Gold-Ingot-4-Carat)  or a normal Gold Ingot in an [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](../../Electric-Machines/Machines/Electric-Ingot-Pulverizer.md) produces one piece of Gold Dust.
- If you are using the [SlimefunOreChunks](../../Other-Plugins/Addons.md#official-addons) addon, you can use the same machines to turn Gold Ore Chunks from the [GEO Miner](../../GPS/GEO-Miner.md) into Gold Dust.

## Usage

Gold Dust can be smelted into [4-carat to 24-carat Gold Ingots](../../Resources/Ingots/Metals/Gold-Ingot.md) in a [Smeltery](../../Basic-Machines/Smeltery.md) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](../../Electric-Machines/Machines/Electric-Ingot-Factory.md).

It is also used in the [Corinthian Bronze Ingot](../../Resources/Ingots/Alloys/Corinthian-Bronze-Ingot.md) [alloy](../../Resources/Ingots/Ingots.md#Alloys), which can be made in a [Smeltery](../../Basic-Machines/Smeltery.md) or an [Electric Smeltery](../../Electric-Machines/Machines/Electric-Smeltery.md).

Gold is one of the most used dusts in Slimefun recipes, either as dust or as [Gold Ingot](../../Resources/Ingots/Metals/Gold-Ingot.md).
