A Connector Node is the component of a [cargo network](Cargo-Management.md) which connects the different parts of the network.

## Obtaining

Connector nodes can be crafted in groups of four in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](../Basic-Machines/Enhanced-Crafting-Table.md).

## Usage

A connector node must be aligned within 6 blocks of a [cargo manager](Cargo-Manager.md) or another connector in range of one, in a straight line (no diagonals).

Connector nodes extend the network's range by an additional 6 blocks. Any [input](Input-Node.md) and [ouput nodes](Output-Node.md) in that range will be connected to the network.

By default, a connector emits red particles along its range when it is connected to a cargo manager. Right-clicking a connector node will display a message about its connection status.
