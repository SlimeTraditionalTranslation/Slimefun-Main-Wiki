title: Cargo Management Overview
---

Cargo Management is Slimefun's item transportation system.

With it, you can quickly and automatically move items between containers or [machines](../Electric-Machines/Electric-Machines.md) over virtually any distance.

A cargo management network requires a [cargo manager](Cargo-Manager.md). It allows items to be transported and gives you information about your network.

Placing [input](Input-Node.md) and [output nodes](Output-Node.md) on a container or machine allows the items in it to enter or exit the network, respectively. These nodes have to be in the direct range of a cargo manager, or they can be connected to one with [connector nodes](Connector-Node.md).

Items in a cargo network are transported over a maximum of 16 separate channels, each labelled with a different color of wool.

For more information on the specific items in this category, see the table of contents below.
