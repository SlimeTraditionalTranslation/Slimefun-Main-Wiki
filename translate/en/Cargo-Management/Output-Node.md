An Ouput Node is the component of a [cargo network](Cargo-Management.md) which receives items sent by an [input node](Input-Node.md).

An output node takes every available item sent through the selected channel. To filter specific items, use [advanced output nodes](Advanced-Output-Node.md), which use a whitelist/blacklist system.

## Obtaining

Output nodes can be crafted in groups of two in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](../Basic-Machines/Enhanced-Crafting-Table.md).

## Usage

An output node moves items from the network into the container or [machine](../Electric-Machines/Electric-Machines.md) on which it is placed.

It must be aligned within 6 blocks of a [cargo manager](Cargo-Manager.md) or a [connector](Connector-Node.md) in range of one (in a straight line; no diagonals).

Right-clicking an input node displays an interface where you can choose the channel from which it receives items.
