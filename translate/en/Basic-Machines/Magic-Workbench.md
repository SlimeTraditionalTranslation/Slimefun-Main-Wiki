The Magic Workbench is a [Basic Machine](Basic-Machines.md) in Slimefun. It is a multiblock structure.

## Obtaining

The Magic Workbench is a multiblock structure which consists of a bookshelf, crafting table and dispenser placed side by side.

A complete setup should look like this:

You can also place an [Output Chest](Output-Chest.md) next to the dispenser to collect your items. If there is no [Output Chest](Output-Chest.md), then it will be put in the dispenser.

## Usage

It is used to craft many [Magical Items](../Magical-Items/Magical-Items.md) and [Magical Gadgets](../Magical-Gadgets/Magical-Gadgets.md).

Check out the Magical Workbench in the Slimefun Guide in-game for all possible recipes.

To craft items in the Magic Workbench, you put the correct recipe in the dispenser then right click the crafting table and if the recipe was correct, it'll output your item.
