## Obtaining

Smelting one [Zinc Dust](/docs/slimefun/zinc-dust) in a [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-factory) yields one Zinc Ingot.

Zinc Ingots can be turned back to [Zinc Dust](/docs/slimefun/zinc-dust) by an [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-pulverizer)

## Usage

Zinc Ingots are used in the following recipes:

* [Battery](/docs/slimefun/battery)
* [GPS Teleporter Pylon](/docs/slimefun/gps-teleporter-pylon)
