The Lumber Axe is a [tool](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Tools) added in Slimefun.

It is a Diamond Axe which allows you to cut down entire trees at once.

## Obtaining

The Lumber Axe can be crafted in a [Magic Workbench](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magic-Workbench).

## Usage

When you break a log with this axe, the connected logs will also be broken, even if they are of a different type. The axe can break up to 100 logs at once, making it easy to cut down entire trees quickly.

It does not work on logs which are connected diagonally, such as acacia tree branches.
