The Soulbound Rune is a [Magical Item](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Items) in Slimefun.

The rune prevents the item it is used on from being dropped upon death, similarly to [Soulbound armor](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Soulbound-Armor), [tools](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Soulbound-Tools) and [weapons](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Soulbound-Weapons).

## Obtaining

Soulbound Runes can be crafted by performing the appropriate ritual at an [Ancient Altar](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Ancient-Altar).

## Usage

You can bind an item to your soul by dropping it, and then dropping a Soulbound Rune next to it.

This will prevent the bound item from being dropped when you die. This consumes the rune, so make sure to use it on the right item.

You can tell an item is Soulbound when it has the "Soulbound" lore under its name.
