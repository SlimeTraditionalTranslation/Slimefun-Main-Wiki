An Android specialized for mining purposes, but can used to break other blocks too.

## Obtaining

Miner Androids can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage

This android can be used to create tunnels, caves, and alikes.
Androids need fuel in order to work, you have to fill them with the [Required Fuel](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Normal-Androids#power-source) before booting!

## Tiers

There is only one tier in this miner android.

| Tier  | Fuel Efficiency |
| ----- | :-------------: |
| Basic | 1.0x            |
