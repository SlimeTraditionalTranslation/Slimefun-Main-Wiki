The Elemental Staves are five kinds of [Magical Gadgets](/docs/slimefun/magical-gadgets).

## Obtaining

Elemental staves can be crafted in a [Magic Workbench](/docs/slimefun/magic-workbench).

## Usage

The generic **Elemental Staff** has no use but is required as a crafting ingredient for the other types of staves.

The **Elemental Staff - Wind** launches you forward when right-clicked, costing 1 Hunger per use. By default, you are launched at 80 m/s (4 m/tick), but this can be configured by a server operator.

The **Elemental Staff - Water** extinguishes the user when right-clicked.

The **Elemental Staff - Fire** is a stick with Fire Aspect V.

The **Elemental Staff - Storm** summons lightning where the user is looking when right-clicked. Unlike the other staves, this staff can only be used 8 times before it breaks.
