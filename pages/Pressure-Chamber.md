You can also place an [Output Chest](/docs/slimefun/output-chest) next to the dispenser to collect your items. If there is no [Output Chest](/docs/slimefun/output-chest), then it will be put in the dispenser.

## Usage

The Pressure Chamber is used to put pressure on items, check out the Pressure Chamber in the Slimefun Guide in-game for more recipes.<br>
To use the Pressure Chamber, put the items (with the correct pattern) in the dispenser and your items will be output when you right click the cauldron.<br>
