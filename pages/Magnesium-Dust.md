Magnesium Dust is one of the nine [dusts](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Dusts) added in Slimefun.

## Obtaining

Magnesium Dust has a ~11.11% chance of being extracted from [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore), by processing it through an [Ore Washer](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Ore-Washer) or an [Electric Dust Washer](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Dust-Washer).

## Usage

Magnesium Dust can be smelted into [Magnesium Ingots](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magnesium-Ingot) in a [Smeltery](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Ingot-Factory).

It is also directly used in creating other items:
