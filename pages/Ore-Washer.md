The Ore Washer is in the [Basic Machines](/docs/slimefun/basic-machines) category. It is a multiblock structure.

## Obtaining

The Ore Washer is a multiblock structure, it consists of a cauldron, a fence and a dispenser.<br>
**Note:** It doesn't matter which side the dispenser is facing, place it to your liking.<br>

A complete setup should look like this:

You can also place an [Output Chest](/docs/slimefun/output-chest) next to the dispenser to collect your washed ores. If there is no [Output Chest](/docs/slimefun/output-chest), then it will be put in the dispenser.

## Usage

Most common use is to wash [Sifted Ore](/docs/slimefun/sifted-ore) into [Dusts](/docs/slimefun/dusts).<br>
Check out the Ore Washer in the Slimefun Guide in-game for more uses.<br>
To use the Ore Washer, you have to put your items in the dispenser, if there is a viable conversion possible when you right click the fence, it'll output the converted item.
