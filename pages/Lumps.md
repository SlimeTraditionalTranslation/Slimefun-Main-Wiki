There are two types of Lumps, Ender and Magical. They're both used to craft a lot of [Magical Items](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Items) and [Magical Gadgets](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Gadgets).

## Obtaining

They each come in three tiers, each tier using 4 of the previous to craft.  
It is crafted in the [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).
