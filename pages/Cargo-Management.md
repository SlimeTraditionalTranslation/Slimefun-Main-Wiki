Cargo Management is Slimefun's item transportation system.

With it, you can quickly and automatically move items between containers or [machines](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines) over virtually any distance.

A cargo management network requires a [cargo manager](/docs/slimefun/cargo-manager). It allows items to be transported and gives you information about your network.

Placing [input](/docs/slimefun/input-node) and [output nodes](/docs/slimefun/output-node) on a container or machine allows the items in it to enter or exit the network, respectively. These nodes have to be in the direct range of a cargo manager, or they can be connected to one with [connector nodes](/docs/slimefun/connector-node).

Items in a cargo network are transported over a maximum of 16 separate channels, each labelled with a different color of wool.

For more information on the specific items in this category, see the table of contents below.
