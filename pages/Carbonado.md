Carbonado is a [Resource](/docs/slimefun/resources) that can be used to craft a variety of other, high-tier endgame items.  
Before you can craft Carbonado, you have to craft Raw Carbonado.

## Obtaining

Raw Carbonado can be crafted in the [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) using 1 [Synthetic Diamond](/docs/slimefun/synthetic-diamond) (vanilla minecraft diamonds will not work), 1 [Carbon Chunk](/docs/slimefun/carbon) and 1 Glass Pane.  
Carbonado can be crafted in the [Pressure Chamber](/docs/slimefun/pressure-chamber) using 1 Raw Carbonado.
