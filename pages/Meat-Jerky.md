Meat Jerky is a [Food](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Food) item added by Slimefun. Using an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table), Beef Jerky, Pork Jerky, Chicken Jerky, Mutton Jerky and Fish Jerky can be made from salt and the corresponding meat.

When consumed, it fully replenishes saturation.
