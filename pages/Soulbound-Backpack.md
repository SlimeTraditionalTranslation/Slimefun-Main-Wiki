Soulbound Backpack is a variant on the Woven [Backpack](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Backpacks).

It only has 36 Inventory Slots which is 18 less than the Gilded [Backpack](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Backpacks), however, it is kept upon death which is why some people prefer it.
