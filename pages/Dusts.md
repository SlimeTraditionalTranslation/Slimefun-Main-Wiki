Slimefun adds the following 9 dusts as [resources](/docs/slimefun/resources):

* [Iron Dust](/docs/slimefun/iron-dust)
* [Gold Dust](/docs/slimefun/gold-dust)
* [Copper Dust](/docs/slimefun/copper-dust)
* [Tin Dust](/docs/slimefun/tin-dust)
* [Silver Dust](/docs/slimefun/silver-dust)
* [Aluminum Dust](/docs/slimefun/aluminum-dust)
* [Lead Dust](/docs/slimefun/lead-dust)
* [Zinc Dust](/docs/slimefun/zinc-dust)
* [Magnesium Dust](/docs/slimefun/magnesium-dust)

## Obtaining

Dusts can be obtained by processing [Sifted Ore](/docs/slimefun/sifted-ore) through an [Ore Washer](/docs/slimefun/ore-washer) or an [Electric Dust Washer](/docs/slimefun/electric-dust-washer).

There is an even chance of getting any kind of dust during the process (= ~11.11% chance).

They can also be produced by crushing the corresponding [ingot](/docs/slimefun/ingots#metals) in an [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-pulverizer).

## Usage

Dusts can be smelted into [alloys](/docs/slimefun/ingots#alloys) or their respective [ingots](/docs/slimefun/ingots#metals) in a [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery).

They can also be smelted in an [Electric Ingot Factory](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-factory) (for ingots) or an [Electric Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/electric-smeltery) (for alloys).
