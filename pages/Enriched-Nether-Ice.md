Enriched Nether Ice is a [Resource](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Resources) that can be used to create [Nether Ice Coolant Cells](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Coolant-Cells) which can be used as coolant for the [Nether Reactor](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Reactors).

## Obtaining

Enriched Nether Ice is crafted with a [Heated Pressure Chamber](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Heated-Pressure-Chamber) using 1 [Plutonium](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Plutonium) and 1 [Nether Ice](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Nether-Ice).

## Handling

Enriched Nether Ice is VERY HIGHLY [Radioactive](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Radiation). Wearing a [Hazmat Suit](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Armor#hazmat-suit) at all times while handling them is *highly recommended*.
