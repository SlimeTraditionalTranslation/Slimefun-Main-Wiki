Neptunium is a [Resource](/docs/slimefun/resources) that can be used to power [Nuclear Reactors](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines#energy-generation) or to create better even better radioactive fuels.

## Obtaining

Neptunium is a byproduct of using [Uranium](/docs/slimefun/uranium) as a fuel for [Nuclear Reactors](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines#energy-generation).

## Handling

Neptunium is HIGHLY [Radioactive](/docs/slimefun/radiation). Wearing a [Hazmat Suit](/docs/slimefun/armor#hazmat-suit) at all times while handling them is *highly recommended*.
