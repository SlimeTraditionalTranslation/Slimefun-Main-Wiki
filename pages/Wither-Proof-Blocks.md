## Obtaining

Both the Wither-Proof Obsidian and Wither-Proof Glass can be crafted in the [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table)

## Special Properties

Both the Wither-Proof Obsidian and Wither-Proof Glass are completely immune to Wither explosions, and cannot be damaged by them.
