Tin Dust is one of the nine [dusts](/docs/slimefun/dusts) added in Slimefun.

## Obtaining

Tin Dust has a ~11.11% chance of being extracted from [Sifted Ore](/docs/slimefun/sifted-ore), by processing it through an [Ore Washer](/docs/slimefun/ore-washer) or an [Electric Dust Washer](/docs/slimefun/electric-dust-washer).

## Usage

Tin Dust can be smelted into [Tin Ingots](/docs/slimefun/tin-ingot) in a [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-factory).

It is also used in the following [alloys](/docs/slimefun/ingots#alloys) for the [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or the [Electric Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/electric-smeltery):

* [Bronze Ingot](/docs/slimefun/bronze-ingot)
* [Solder Ingot](/docs/slimefun/solder-ingot)
