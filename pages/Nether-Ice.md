Nether Ice is a [Resource](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Resources) that can be used to create [Enriched Nether Ice](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enriched-Nether-Ice), a powerful reactor coolant.

## Obtaining

Nether Ice must be obtained through a [GEO Miner](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/GEO-Miner) in the Nether.

## Handling

Nether Ice is MODERATELY [Radioactive](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Radiation). Wearing a [Hazmat Suit](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Armor#hazmat-suit) at all times while handling them is *highly recommended*.
