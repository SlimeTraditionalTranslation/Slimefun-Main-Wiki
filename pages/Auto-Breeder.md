The Auto Breeder is an [Electric Machine](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) that can be used to breed two animals automatically.

It runs on [Organic Food](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Miscellaneous-Items) which is made in the [Food Fabricator](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Food-Fabricator).  
The Auto Breeder still respects the vanilla breeding time.

## Auto Breeder Tiers

There is only one tier of the Auto Breeder and it has the following properties:  

**Power Usage**: 60 J/Animal  
**Buffer**: 1024 J
