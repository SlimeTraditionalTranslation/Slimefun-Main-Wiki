The Reinforced Spawner is an item in the [Magical Gadgets](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Gadgets) category.  
They are the working counterpart of [Broken Spawners](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Broken-Spawner).

## Obtaining

A Reinforced Spawner can be obtained by repairing a [Broken Spawner](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Broken-Spawner) at an [Ancient Altar](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Ancient-Altar). The mob type will be the same as the original spawner it came from.

## Usage

A Reinforced Spawner may be placed down like any other block. It follows the same spawning mechanics as a vanilla spawner.
