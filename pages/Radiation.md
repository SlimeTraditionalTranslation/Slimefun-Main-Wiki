Radiation is an effect of radioactive items in Slimefun.

More specifically, it is a deadly combination of status effects you receive when carrying such items: Wither III, Blindness IV, Confusion IV, Weakness III, Slowness II, and Mining Fatigue II, for a duration of 20 seconds.

For this reason, it is highly recommended you only carry them for a short amount of time. Better yet, wear a full [hazmat suit](/docs/slimefun/armor#hazmat-suit): this will make you completely immune to the effects of radiation.

## Radioactive items

The following items will induce radiation while in your inventory:

* [Blistering Ingot](/docs/slimefun/blistering-ingot)
* [Small Chunk of Uranium](/docs/slimefun/uranium)
* [Uranium](/docs/slimefun/uranium)
* [Neptunium](/docs/slimefun/neptunium)
* [Plutonium](/docs/slimefun/plutonium)
* [Boosted Uranium](/docs/slimefun/boosted-uranium)
* [Nether Ice](/docs/slimefun/nether-ice)
* [Enriched Nether Ice](/docs/slimefun/enriched-nether-ice)

Not listed here is the [Nether Star Reactor](/docs/slimefun/reactors), which makes nearby entities wither, but does not actually cause radiation.
