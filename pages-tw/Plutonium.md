Plutonium is a [Resource](/docs/slimefun/resources) that can be used to power
[Nuclear Reactors](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines#energy-generation) or to create even better radioactive fuels.

## Obtaining

Plutonium is a byproduct of using [Neptunium](/docs/slimefun/neptunium) as a fuel for [Nuclear Reactors](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines#energy-generation).

## Handling

Plutonium is VERY HIGHLY [Radioactive](/docs/slimefun/radiation). Wearing a [Hazmat Suit](/docs/slimefun/armor#hazmat-suit) at all times while handling them is *highly recommended*.
