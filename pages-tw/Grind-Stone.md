The Grind Stone can be used to grind items/blocks into other items/blocks, check out the Grind Stone in the Slimefun Guide in-game for more recipes.<br> To use the Grind Stone, you need to put your items in the dispenser and then right click the fence to convert your items, if a viable conversion is possible.
