Copper Dust is one of the nine [dusts](/docs/slimefun/dusts) added in Slimefun.

## Obtaining

Copper Dust has a ~11.11% chance of being extracted from [Sifted Ore](/docs/slimefun/sifted-ore), by processing it through an [Ore Washer](/docs/slimefun/ore-washer) or an [Electric Dust Washer](/docs/slimefun/electric-dust-washer).

## Usage

Copper Dust can be smelted into [Copper Ingots](/docs/slimefun/copper-ingot) in a [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-factory).

It is also used in the following [alloys](/docs/slimefun/ingots#alloys) for the [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or the [Electric Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/electric-smeltery):

* [Bronze Ingot](/docs/slimefun/bronze-ingot)
* [Duralumin Ingot](/docs/slimefun/duralumin-ingot)
* [Billon Ingot](/docs/slimefun/billon-ingot)
* [Brass Ingot](/docs/slimefun/brass-ingot)
* [Corinthian Bronze Ingot](/docs/slimefun/corinthian-bronze-ingot)
* [Nickel Ingot](/docs/slimefun/nickel-ingot)
* [Cobalt Ingot](/docs/slimefun/cobalt-ingot)

Copper is one of the most used dusts in Slimefun recipes, either as dust or as [Copper Ingot](/docs/slimefun/copper-ingot).
