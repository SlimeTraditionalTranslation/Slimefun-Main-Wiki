Enriched Nether Ice is a [Resource](/docs/slimefun/resources) that can be used to create [Nether Ice Coolant Cells](/docs/slimefun/coolant-cells) which can be used as coolant for the [Nether Reactor](/docs/slimefun/reactors).

## Obtaining

Enriched Nether Ice is crafted with a [Heated Pressure Chamber](/docs/slimefun/heated-pressure-chamber) using 1 [Plutonium](/docs/slimefun/plutonium) and 1 [Nether Ice](/docs/slimefun/nether-ice).

## Handling

Enriched Nether Ice is VERY HIGHLY [Radioactive](/docs/slimefun/radiation). Wearing a [Hazmat Suit](/docs/slimefun/armor#hazmat-suit) at all times while handling them is *highly recommended*.
