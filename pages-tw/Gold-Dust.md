Gold Dust is one of the nine [dusts](/docs/slimefun/dusts) added in Slimefun.

## Obtaining

- Crushing Gold Ore in an [Ore Crusher](/docs/slimefun/ore-crusher) or an [Electric Ore Grinder](/docs/slimefun/electric-ore-grinder) yields two pieces of Gold Dust.

- Gold Dust has a ~11.11% chance of being extracted from [Sifted Ore](/docs/slimefun/sifted-ore), by processing it through an [Ore Washer](/docs/slimefun/ore-washer) or an [Electric Dust Washer](/docs/slimefun/electric-dust-washer).
- Crushing a [4-carat Gold Ingot](/docs/slimefun/gold-ingot#gold-ingot-4-carat)  or a normal Gold Ingot in an [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-pulverizer) produces one piece of Gold Dust.
- If you are using the [SlimefunOreChunks](/docs/slimefun/addons#official-addons) addon, you can use the same machines to turn Gold Ore Chunks from the [GEO Miner](/docs/slimefun/geo-miner) into Gold Dust.

## Usage

Gold Dust can be smelted into [4-carat to 24-carat Gold Ingots](/docs/slimefun/gold-ingot) in a [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-factory).

It is also used in the [Corinthian Bronze Ingot](/docs/slimefun/corinthian-bronze-ingot) [alloy](/docs/slimefun/ingots#alloys), which can be made in a [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or an [Electric Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/electric-smeltery).

Gold is one of the most used dusts in Slimefun recipes, either as dust or as [Gold Ingot](/docs/slimefun/gold-ingot).
