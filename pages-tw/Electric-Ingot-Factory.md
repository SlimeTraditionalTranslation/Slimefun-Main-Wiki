The Electric Ingot Factory is an [Electric Machine](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines) which smelts [Dusts](/docs/slimefun/dusts) into their corresponding [Ingots](/docs/slimefun/ingots).  
It cannot smelt [Alloys](/docs/slimefun/ingots#alloys) from [Ingots](/docs/slimefun/ingots).

The [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-pulverizer) is the opposite of this machine.
