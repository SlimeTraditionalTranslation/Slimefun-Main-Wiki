## Obtaining

Smelting one [Lead Dust](/docs/slimefun/lead-dust) in a [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-factory) yields one Lead Ingot.

Lead Ingots can be turned back to [Lead Dust](/docs/slimefun/lead-dust) by an [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-pulverizer)

## Usage

Lead Ingots are used in the following [alloys](/docs/slimefun/ingots#alloys) for the [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or the [Electric Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/electric-smeltery):

* [Solder Ingot](/docs/slimefun/solder-ingot)
* [Aluminum Brass Ingot](/docs/slimefun/aluminum-brass-ingot)
* [Aluminum Bronze Ingot](/docs/slimefun/aluminum-bronze-ingot)

It is used in the following recipes:
