This page contains information regarding following items:

- Elytra Scale
- Elytra
- Infused Elytra
- Soulbound Elytra

## Obtaining & Usage

These items can be found in the [Magical Gadgets](/docs/slimefun/magical-gadgets) category. Their exact recipes can be found in-game.  
The Elytra Scale is a crafting component, while the other three are usable elytras.

| Item | Specialities |
| ---- | -------- |
| Elytra | N/A |
| Infused Elytra | Comes with Mending |
| Soulbound Elytra | Kept on death |

Fun fact: these were implemented due to the fact that big servers run out of elytras quick, and it only became harder and harder for new players to obtain them.
