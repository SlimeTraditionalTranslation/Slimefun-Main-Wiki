The Gold Pan is a very important item that is part of the [Tools](/docs/slimefun/tools) category. There are two variants, the normal Gold Pan and the [Nether Gold Pan](/docs/slimefun/nether-gold-pan).

This page will only cover the standard Gold Pan.

## How to use the Gold Pan

You right-click a block of gravel while holding a Gold Pan in your main hand.

The block will break and drop Flint, Clay, [Sifted Ore](/docs/slimefun/sifted-ore) or an Iron Nugget.

You can read more about [Sifted Ore](/docs/slimefun/sifted-ore) and how to use it in Slimefun's ["Getting Started" Guide](/docs/slimefun/getting-started).

## Drop chances

Each item you can get with a Gold Pan has a different probability to drop, listed below.

| Item                                    | Chance |
| --------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Flint                                   | 40%    |
| [Sifted Ore](/docs/slimefun/sifted-ore) | 35%    |
| Clay                                    | 20%    |
| Iron Nugget                             | 5%     |
