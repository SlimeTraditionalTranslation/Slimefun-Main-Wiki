The Tome of Knowledge Sharing is part of the [Magical Gadgets](/docs/slimefun/magical-gadgets) category.

## Obtaining

This item can be crafted in the [Magic Workbench](/docs/slimefun/magic-workbench).

## Usage

This item is capable to **copy** all researched items from one person to another. This way not every one has to farm xp for days.  
Using it is rather simple, right click the book to assign it to yourself and then hand it to a friend. When the friend right clicks the book he will learn all your researches.
