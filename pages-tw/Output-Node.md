An Ouput Node is the component of a [cargo network](/docs/slimefun/cargo-management) which receives items sent by an [input node](/docs/slimefun/input-node).

An output node takes every available item sent through the selected channel. To filter specific items, use [advanced output nodes](/docs/slimefun/advanced-output-node), which use a whitelist/blacklist system.

## Obtaining

Output nodes can be crafted in groups of two in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](/docs/slimefun/enhanced-crafting-table).

## Usage

An output node moves items from the network into the container or [machine](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines) on which it is placed.

It must be aligned within 6 blocks of a [cargo manager](/docs/slimefun/cargo-manager) or a [connector](/docs/slimefun/connector-node) in range of one (in a straight line; no diagonals).

Right-clicking an input node displays an interface where you can choose the channel from which it receives items.
