Slimefun adds 11 new Gold Ingots to the game.

They are differentiated by their purity (measured in "carats"), with the lowest purity being 4 and the highest being 24.

## Obtaining

Smelting [Gold Dust](/docs/slimefun/gold-dust) in a [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-factory) produces a 4-carat Gold Ingot.

Higher purity gold is obtained by smelting any carat gold along with a piece of [Gold Dust](/docs/slimefun/gold-dust). This "adds" 2 carats, up until 24-carat gold, thus 11 [Gold Dust](/docs/slimefun/gold-dust) are needed to create a single 24-carat Gold Ingot.

## Usage

Slimefun Gold Ingots cannot substitute regular Gold Ingots in vanilla recipes. Instead, they are used in new recipes.
