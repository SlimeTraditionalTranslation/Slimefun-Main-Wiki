## Obtaining

Smelting one [Magnesium Dust](/docs/slimefun/magnesium-dust) in a [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-factory) yields one Magnesium Ingot.

Magnesium Ingots can be turned back to [Magnesium Dust](/docs/slimefun/magnesium-dust) by an [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-pulverizer)

## Usage

Currently Magnesium Ingots are not used directly in any base Slimefun recipes.
