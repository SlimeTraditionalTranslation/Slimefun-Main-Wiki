Nether Ice is a [Resource](/docs/slimefun/resources) that can be used to create [Enriched Nether Ice](/docs/slimefun/enriched-nether-ice), a powerful reactor coolant.

## Obtaining

Nether Ice must be obtained through a [GEO Miner](/docs/slimefun/geo-miner) in the Nether.

## Handling

Nether Ice is MODERATELY [Radioactive](/docs/slimefun/radiation). Wearing a [Hazmat Suit](/docs/slimefun/armor#hazmat-suit) at all times while handling them is *highly recommended*.
