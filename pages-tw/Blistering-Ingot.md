Blistering Ingots are [Resources](/docs/slimefun/resources) that can be used to craft [Reactor](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines#energy-generation) related items and [End-Game Machines](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines).

## Obtaining

Blistering Ingots can be crafted in a [Heated Pressure Chamber](/docs/slimefun/heated-pressure-chamber) using 1 [24-Carat Gold Ingot](/docs/slimefun/gold-ingot) and 1 [Uranium](/docs/slimefun/uranium).

## Handling

Blistering Ingots are HIGHLY [Radioactive](/docs/slimefun/radiation). Wearing a [Hazmat Suit](/docs/slimefun/armor#hazmat-suit) at all times while handling them is *highly recommended*.
