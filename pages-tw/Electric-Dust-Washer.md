The Electric Dust Washer is an [Electric Machine](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines) which obtains [Dusts](/docs/slimefun/dusts) from [Sifted Ore](/docs/slimefun/sifted-ore).

It's the electric version of the [Ore Washer](/docs/slimefun/ore-washer), only it does not generate by-products and thus improves the yield rate.

## Electric Dust Washer Tiers

| Tier | Power  |  Time  | Buffer | Energy/Ore |
|:----:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:----------:|
|  I   | 6 J/s  |  4 s   | 128 J  |    24 J    |
|  II  | 10 J/s |  2 s   | 128 J  |    20 J    |
| III  | 30 J/s | 0.33 s | 512 J  |    10 J    |

## Tip

Seeing as sifted ore can produce many different dusts, it is recommended to hook it up to a cargo system because it only has 2 output slots and they will fill pretty quickly.
