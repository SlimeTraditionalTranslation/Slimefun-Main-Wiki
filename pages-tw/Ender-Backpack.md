The Ender Backpack is part of the [Magical Gadgets](/docs/slimefun/magical-gadgets) category.  
Practically seen this is just a Portable Enderchest.

This item can be very useful to take with you because you don't need to carry a pickaxe with the Silk Touch enchantment if you want to access your Enderchest on the go.

## Obtaining

This item can be crafted in the [Magic Workbench](/docs/slimefun/magic-workbench).
