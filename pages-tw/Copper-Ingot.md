## Obtaining

Smelting one [Copper Dust](/docs/slimefun/copper-dust) in a [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-factory) yields one Copper Ingot.

Copper Ingots can be turned back to [Copper Dust](/docs/slimefun/copper-dust) by an [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-pulverizer)

## Usage

Copper Ingots are used in the following recipes:

* [Copper Wire](/docs/slimefun/copper-wire)
* [Battery](/docs/slimefun/battery)
