Magnesium Dust is one of the nine [dusts](/docs/slimefun/dusts) added in Slimefun.

## Obtaining

Magnesium Dust has a ~11.11% chance of being extracted from [Sifted Ore](/docs/slimefun/sifted-ore), by processing it through an [Ore Washer](/docs/slimefun/ore-washer) or an [Electric Dust Washer](/docs/slimefun/electric-dust-washer).

## Usage

Magnesium Dust can be smelted into [Magnesium Ingots](/docs/slimefun/magnesium-ingot) in a [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-factory).

It is also directly used in creating other items:

* [Magnesium Salt](/docs/slimefun/magnesium-salt)
