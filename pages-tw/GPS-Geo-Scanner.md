The GPS Geo-Scanner is a placeable tool added in the [GPS](/docs/slimefun/gps) category.

## Obtaining

The GPS Geo-Scanner can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](/docs/slimefun/enhanced-crafting-table).

## Usage

Right-Clicking on a placed GPS Geo-Scanner opens a chest GUI with the overview of mineable resources of a given chunk.

These resources are only obtainable using an [Oil Pump](/docs/slimefun/oil-pump) or a [GEO Miner](/docs/slimefun/geo-miner).

Scanning requires a [GPS network complexity](/docs/slimefun/gps-transmitter) of at least 600.
