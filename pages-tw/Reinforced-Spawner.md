The Reinforced Spawner is an item in the [Magical Gadgets](/docs/slimefun/magical-gadgets) category.  
They are the working counterpart of [Broken Spawners](/docs/slimefun/broken-spawner).

## Obtaining

A Reinforced Spawner can be obtained by repairing a [Broken Spawner](/docs/slimefun/broken-spawner) at an [Ancient Altar](/docs/slimefun/ancient-altar). The mob type will be the same as the original spawner it came from.

## Usage

A Reinforced Spawner may be placed down like any other block. It follows the same spawning mechanics as a vanilla spawner.
