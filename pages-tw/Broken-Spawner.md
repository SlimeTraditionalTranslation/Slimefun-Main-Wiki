Broken Spawners are an item in the [Magical Items](/docs/slimefun/magical-items) category.

As the name implies, they do not function in this state.

## Obtaining

A Broken Spawner can be acquired by destroying a vanilla spawner with a [Pickaxe of Containment](/docs/slimefun/pickaxe-of-containment). The mob type will be the same as the original, working spawner.

## Usage

A Broken Spawner does not work and cannot be placed. However, it can be [repaired](/docs/slimefun/reinforced-spawner) by performing the correct ritual (found in your Slimefun guide) at an [Ancient Altar](/docs/slimefun/ancient-altar).
