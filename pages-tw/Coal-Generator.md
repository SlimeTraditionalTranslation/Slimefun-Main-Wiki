The Coal Generator is a type of [Energy Generator](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines#energy-generation).

## Obtaining

All tiers of coal generators can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](/docs/slimefun/enhanced-crafting-table).

## Usage

A coal generator must be placed within 7 blocks of an [Energy Regulator](/docs/slimefun/energy-regulator), an [Energy Connector](/docs/slimefun/energy-connector), or an [Energy Capacitor](/docs/slimefun/energy-capacitors) in a cross format (not diagonally), and provided with the appropriate fuel.  

## Tiers

There are currently two tiers of coal generators.

| Tier | Energy | Buffer |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| I    | 16 J/s | 64 J   |
| II   | 30 J/s | 256 J  |

## Fuel

Despite being a "coal" generator, this generator can also be fueled with blaze rods, wood logs, planks and other wooden items.

| Fuel                       | Burning time | Total (Tier I) | Total (Tier II) |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| Block of Coal              | 1m 20s       | 1.28 kJ        | 2.4 kJ          |
| Dried Kelp Block           | 20s          | 320 J          | 600 J           |
| Blaze Rod                  | 12s          | 192 J          | 360 J           |
| Coal                       | 8s           | 128 J          | 240 J           |
| Any Log                    | 4s           | 64 J           | 120 J           |
| Any Planks                 | 1s           | 16 J           | 30 J            |
| Any Boats                  | 5s           | 80 J           | 150 J           |
| Any Wooden Slabs           | 1s           | 16 J           | 30 J            |
| Any Wooden Buttons         | 1s           | 16 J           | 30 J            |
| Any Wooden Fences          | 1s           | 16 J           | 30 J            |
| Any Wooden Trapdoors       | 3s           | 48 J           | 90 J            |
| Any Wooden Pressure Plates | 2s           | 32 J           | 60 J            |
| Any Wooden Doors           | 3s           | 48 J           | 90 J            |
| Any Signs                  | 2s           | 32 J           | 60 J            |

Note that it is twice as efficient to turn your logs into planks in a [Table Saw](/docs/slimefun/table-saw) before burning them as fuel.
