Iron Ingots are an item in vanilla Minecraft.

Although they are not added by Slimefun, the plugin offers an additional way to obtain them, and they are used in various new recipes.

## Obtaining

You can produce Iron Ingots by smelting [Iron Dust](/docs/slimefun/iron-dust) in a [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-factory).

Iron Ingots can be turned back to [Iron Dust](/docs/slimefun/iron-dust) by an [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-pulverizer)

## Usage

Besides their uses in the game's base recipes, Iron Ingots can be turned into [Iron Dust](/docs/slimefun/iron-dust) by crushing them in an [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-pulverizer).

Additionally, Iron Ingots are used to make the following alloys:

* [Cobalt Ingot](/docs/slimefun/cobalt-ingot)
* [Damascus Steel Ingot](/docs/slimefun/damascus-steel-ingot)
* [Ferrosilicon](/docs/slimefun/ferrosilicon)
* [Steel Ingot](/docs/slimefun/steel-ingot)

They are also a crafting ingredient for the following items and machines:

* [Ancient Rune [Lightning]](/docs/slimefun/ancient-runes)
* [Block Placer](/docs/slimefun/block-placer)
* [Electric Gold Pan (II)](/docs/slimefun/electric-gold-pan)
