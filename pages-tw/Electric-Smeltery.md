The Electric Smeltery is an [Electric Machine](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines) which creates [Alloys](/docs/slimefun/ingots#alloys) from [Ingots](/docs/slimefun/ingots).  
If you want to smelt [Dusts](/docs/slimefun/dusts) into [Ingots](/docs/slimefun/ingots), take a look at the [Electric Ingot Factory](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-factory).

It is the automated version of the [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery).
