The GPS Transmitter is a basic component of a GPS network, which is a building block of the [GPS](/docs/slimefun/gps) category.

## Obtaining

The GPS Transmitters can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](/docs/slimefun/enhanced-crafting-table).

## Usage and mechanics

The GPS Transmitter adds GPS network complexity equal to `TierModifier * Height + TierBonus`, based on the tier of the Transmitter and its Y-coordinate.

## Tiers

The table below describes differences between tiers of Transmitters.

| Tier | Buffer | Consumption | Tier Modifier | Tier Bonus |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| GPS Transmitter | 16 J | 2 J/s | 1 | 0 |
| Advanced GPS Transmitter | 64 J | 6 J/s | 4 | 100 |
| Carbonado GPS Transmitter | 256 J | 22 J/s | 16 | 500 |
| Energized GPS Transmitter | 1024 J | 92 J/s | 64 | 600 |
