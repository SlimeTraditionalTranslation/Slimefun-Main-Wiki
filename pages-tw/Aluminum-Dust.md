Aluminum Dust is one of the nine [dusts](/docs/slimefun/dusts) added in Slimefun.

## Obtaining

Aluminum Dust has a ~11.11% chance of being extracted from [Sifted Ore](/docs/slimefun/sifted-ore), by processing it through an [Ore Washer](/docs/slimefun/ore-washer) or an [Electric Dust Washer](/docs/slimefun/electric-dust-washer).

## Usage

Aluminum Dust can be smelted into [Aluminum Ingots](/docs/slimefun/aluminum-ingot) in a [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-factory).

It is also used in the following [alloys](/docs/slimefun/ingots#alloys) for the [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or the [Electric Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/electric-smeltery):

* [Aluminum Brass Ingot](/docs/slimefun/aluminum-brass-ingot)
* [Aluminum Bronze Ingot](/docs/slimefun/aluminum-bronze-ingot)
* [Duralumin Ingot](/docs/slimefun/duralumin-ingot)

... and directly in creating other items:

* [Magnet](/docs/slimefun/magnet)
* [Duct Tape](/docs/slimefun/miscellaneous-items)
* [Synthetic Emerald](/docs/slimefun/synthetic-emerald)

Aluminum is one of the most used dusts in Slimefun recipes, either as dust or as [Aluminum Ingot](/docs/slimefun/aluminum-ingot).
