Among the [Weapons](/docs/slimefun/weapons) it adds, Slimefun introduces three new bows: the Soulbound Bow, the Explosive Bow, and the Icy Bow.<br> They each have special properties and may be enchanted like any other Bow.

## 靈魂綁定弓

The Soulbound Bow remains in your inventory upon death.<br> *See also: [Soulbound Weapons](/docs/slimefun/soulbound-weapons)*

## 爆裂弓

Arrows fired by the Explosive Bow launch the Player or Mob they hit into the air.

## 寒冰弓

Arrows fired by the Icy Bow prevent the Player or Mob they hit from moving for 2 seconds. They will be immune to freezing for 5 seconds afterwards.
