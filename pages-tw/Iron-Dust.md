Iron Dust is one of the nine [dusts](/docs/slimefun/dusts) added in Slimefun.

## Obtaining

Crushing Iron Ore in an [Ore Crusher](/docs/slimefun/ore-crusher) or an [Electric Ore Grinder](/docs/slimefun/electric-ore-grinder) yields two pieces of Iron Dust, effectively doubling it.

If you are using the [SlimefunOreChunks](/docs/slimefun/addons#official-addons) addon, you can use the same machines to turn Iron Ore Chunks from the [GEO Miner](/docs/slimefun/geo-miner) into Iron Dust.

Iron Dust has a ~11.11% chance of being extracted from [Sifted Ore](/docs/slimefun/sifted-ore), by processing it through an [Ore Washer](/docs/slimefun/ore-washer) or an [Electric Dust Washer](/docs/slimefun/electric-dust-washer).

Additionally, crushing an [Iron Ingot](/docs/slimefun/iron-ingot) in an [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-pulverizer) produces one piece of Iron Dust.

## Usage

Iron Dust can be smelted into [Iron Ingots](/docs/slimefun/iron-ingot) in a [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](/docs/slimefun/electric-ingot-factory).

It is also used in the following [alloys](/docs/slimefun/ingots#alloys) for the [Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/smeltery) or the [Electric Smeltery](/docs/slimefun/electric-smeltery):

* [Steel Ingot](/docs/slimefun/steel-ingot)
* [Damascus Steel Ingot](/docs/slimefun/damascus-steel-ingot)
* [Ferrosilicon](/docs/slimefun/ferrosilicon)
* [Gilded Iron](/docs/slimefun/gilded-iron)
* [Nickel Ingot](/docs/slimefun/nickel-ingot)
* [Cobalt Ingot](/docs/slimefun/cobalt-ingot)

... and directly in creating other items:

* [Magnet](/docs/slimefun/magnet)

Iron is one of the most used dusts in Slimefun recipes, either as dust or as [Iron Ingot](/docs/slimefun/iron-ingot).
