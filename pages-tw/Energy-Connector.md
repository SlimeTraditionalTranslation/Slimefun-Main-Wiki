The Energy Connector is an [Electric Component](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines) which can transfer energy in an Energy Network. Unlike an [Energy Capacitor](/docs/slimefun/energy-capacitors), it has no buffer.

## Usage

An energy capacitor must be placed within 7 blocks of an [Electric Machine](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines#machines), [Energy Generator](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines#energy-generation), [Energy Regulator](/docs/slimefun/energy-regulator), or another capacitor (in a straight line; no diagonals).

They transfer energy between blocks in that range, so they can be used to extend your network.
