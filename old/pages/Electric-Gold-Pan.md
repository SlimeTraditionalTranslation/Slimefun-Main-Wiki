The Electric Gold Pan is an [Electric Machine](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines) which obtains [Sifted Ore](/docs/slimefun/sifted-ore) from gravel, just like the [Gold Pan](/docs/slimefun/gold-pan) and the [Automated Panning Machine](/docs/slimefun/automated-panning-machine).

Unlike the [Electric Dust Washer](/docs/slimefun/electric-dust-washer) it still produces by-products and thus the yield rate is exactly the same as its non-electric variants.
