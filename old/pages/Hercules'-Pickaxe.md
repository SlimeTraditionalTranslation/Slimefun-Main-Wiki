The Hercules' Pickaxe is an item in the [tools](/docs/slimefun/tools) category.

## Obtaining

The Hercules' Pickaxe can be crafted in a [Magic Workbench](/docs/slimefun/magic-workbench).

## Usage

This tool is similar in function to an [Ore Crusher](/docs/slimefun/ore-crusher) or an [Electric Ore Grinder](/docs/slimefun/electric-ore-grinder): it crushes iron ore mined with it into [iron dust](/docs/slimefun/iron-dust), and gold ore into [gold dust](/docs/slimefun/gold-dust).

It also doubles the resources dropped from other ores.
