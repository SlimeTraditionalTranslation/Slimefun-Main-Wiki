An Output Chest is a [Basic Machine](/docs/slimefun/basic-machines) in Slimefun.

It is a chest which, when placed adjacent to the Dispenser part of a Basic Machine, collects any items crafted with it.

It can also be placed next to the Stonecutter in a [Table Saw](/docs/slimefun/table-saw), or the Cauldron in an [Automated Panning Machine](/docs/slimefun/automated-panning-machine).
