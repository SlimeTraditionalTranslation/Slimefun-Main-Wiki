The Grappling Hook is a useful [tool](/docs/slimefun/tools) which provides great mobility, allowing you to access otherwise hard-to-reach places.

## Obtaining

The Grappling Hook can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](/docs/slimefun/enhanced-crafting-table).

## Usage

Right-clicking with a Grappling Hook in your main hand will shoot an arrow with a lead attached to it.

Once the arrow hits a block or entity, it will quickly pull you towards it.

The Grappling Hook will then be dropped as an item wherever the arrow landed, so it can be picked up and reused.

The arrow also deals 4 damage (2 hearts) to any living entity it hits, so it can be potentially weaponized.
