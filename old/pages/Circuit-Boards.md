Circuit Boards are [Technical Components](/docs/slimefun/technical-components) that can be used in various crafting recipes.

## Obtaining

### Basic Circuit Board

The Basic Circuit Board can be obtained by manually killing an Iron Golem. Upon the death of the Iron Golem, it has a chance of dropping one Basic Circuit Board. This chance is 75% by default, but it can be changed in the configuration files by a server operator.

### Advanced Circuit Board

The Advanced Circuit Board can be obtained via crafting in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](/docs/slimefun/enhanced-crafting-table).
