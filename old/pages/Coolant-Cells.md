Coolant Cells are a set of [Technical Components](/docs/slimefun/technical-components) that are used as coolant for the [Nuclear Reactor](/docs/slimefun/reactors) and [Nether Star Reactor](/docs/slimefun/reactors).

## Obtaining

### Reactor Coolant Cell

Reactor Coolant Cells are created in the [Freezer](/docs/slimefun/freezer).

### Nether Ice Coolant Cell

Nether Ice Coolant Cells are created in the [Heated Pressure Chamber](/docs/slimefun/heated-pressure-chamber).

## Usage

### Reactor Coolant Cell

Reactor Coolant Cells are used to cool the [Nuclear Reactor](/docs/slimefun/reactors) and are required for its operation.

### Nether Ice Coolant Cell

Nether Ice Coolant Cells are used to cool the [Nether Star Reactor](/docs/slimefun/reactors) and are required for its operation.
