Uranium is a [Resource](/docs/slimefun/resources) that can be used to power [Nuclear Reactors](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines#energy-generation) or to create even better radioactive fuels.

## Obtaining

Uranium can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](/docs/slimefun/enhanced-crafting-table) using 4 [Small Chunks of Uranium](/docs/slimefun/miscellaneous-items).

## Handling

Uranium is MODERATELY [Radioactive](/docs/slimefun/radiation). Wearing a [Hazmat Suit](/docs/slimefun/armor#hazmat-suit) at all times while handling them is *highly recommended*.
