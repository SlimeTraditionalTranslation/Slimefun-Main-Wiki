A Trash Can is a container that destroys any item placed in it, much like the [Portable Dustbin](/docs/slimefun/portable-dustbin).  
Unlike its portable equivalent, it must be placed down before it can be used, and it is fully compatible with cargo nodes, making it easy to destroy any unwanted items in a [Cargo Network](/docs/slimefun/cargo-management).

## Obtaining

A trash can can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](/docs/slimefun/enhanced-crafting-table).

## Usage

Right-clicking a trash can after placing it (also right click) displays a chest-like interface where items can be moved.  
Items disappear shortly after being placed in a trash can, unlike the portable dustbin, which waits for the interface to be closed.

You can move items into a trash can manually, but it is also able to receive items through an [Output Node](/docs/slimefun/output-node) or an [Advanced Output Nodes](/docs/slimefun/advanced-output-node).
