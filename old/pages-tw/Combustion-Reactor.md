The Combustion Reactor is a type of [Energy Generator](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines#energy-generation).

## Obtaining

A Combustion Reactor can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](/docs/slimefun/enhanced-crafting-table).

## Usage

A Combustion Reactor must be placed within 7 blocks of an [Energy Regulator](/docs/slimefun/energy-regulator), an [Energy Connector](/docs/slimefun/energy-connector), or an [Energy Capacitor](/docs/slimefun/energy-capacitors) in a cross format (not diagonally), and provided with the appropriate fuel.

Once it is placed, right-click it and place fuel in its inventory (two slots on the left).

## Tiers

There is only one tier of the Combustion Reactor.

| Tier | Energy | Buffer |
| :--: | :----: | :----: |
| I    | 24 J/s | 256 J  |

## Fuel

This generator can be fueled using Buckets of Oil and Buckets of Fuel.

| Fuel           | Burning time | Total (Tier I) |
| :------------- | :----------: | :------------: |
| Bucket of Oil  | 30s          | 720 J          |
| Bucket of Fuel | 90s          | 2.16 kJ        |

Note that it is more efficient to turn your Buckets of Oil into Buckets of Fuel in a [Refinery](/docs/slimefun/refinery) before burning them as fuel.
