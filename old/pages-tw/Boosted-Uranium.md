Boosted Uranium is a [Resource](/docs/slimefun/resources) that can be used to power [Nuclear Reactors](/docs/slimefun/electric-machines#energy-generation).
Out of all nuclear fuels, Boosted Uranium burns the longest and generates the most energy the fastest.

## Obtaining

Boosted Uranium can be crafted through a [Heated Pressure Chamber](/docs/slimefun/heated-pressure-chamber) using 1 [Plutonium](/docs/slimefun/plutonium) and 1 [Uranium](/docs/slimefun/uranium).

## Handling

Boosted Uranium is VERY HIGHLY [Radioactive](/docs/slimefun/radiation). Wearing a [Hazmat Suit](/docs/slimefun/armor#hazmat-suit) at all times while handling them is *highly recommended*.
