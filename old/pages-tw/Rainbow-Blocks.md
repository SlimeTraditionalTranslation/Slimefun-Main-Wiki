These are all the non-seasonal rainbow blocks that can be crafted.

- Rainbow Glass
- Rainbow Glass Pane
- Rainbow Clay
- Rainbow Concrete
- Rainbow Terracotta
- Rainbow Wool

## Obtaining

These items are part of the [Magical Gadgets](/docs/slimefun/magical-gadgets) category. Their exact recipes can be found in-game.  
Do note that these also exist for specific seasons (eg. Halloween Rainbow blocks). These can be found in their corresponding [Seasonal Categories](/docs/slimefun/seasonal-categories).

## Usage & Specifications

These blocks will cycle through all 16 minecraft colours in following order:

- white
- orange
- light_purple
- light_blue
- yellow
- lime
- pink
- dark_gray
- light_gray
- cyan
- purple
- dark_blue
- brown
- dark_green
- red
- black  

When placed, all blocks of the same type (eg. all Rainbow Wool blocks) will synchronize and display the same colour.  
This does not automatically happen between two different types (eg. Rainbow wool and Rainbow glass).  
You can still sync them if you place every new block when the surrounding blocks are white.

When you break any of these items with any tool, they will drop back the original Rainbow version (this includes glass and glass panes).
