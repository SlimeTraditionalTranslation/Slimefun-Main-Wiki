The Cooler is an [Item](/docs/slimefun/items) that has a unique use.<br>
It allows you to carry Juices and automatically consume them when your Player gets hungry.

## Obtaining

The Cooler can be crafted in the [Enhanced Crafting Table](/docs/slimefun/enhanced-crafting-table).

## Usage

The Cooler can be used while holding the item by right clicking. Upon right clicking, the item will open up a chest GUI in which the player can place any [Juice](/docs/slimefun/juices). If the cooler is in the player's inventory, and the player is hungry, the cooler will automatically feed the player the juices inside.
