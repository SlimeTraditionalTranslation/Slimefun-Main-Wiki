The Pickaxe of Containment is an item in the [Tools](/docs/slimefun/tools) category.

It is an Iron Pickaxe which allows you to pick up spawners. Although it can be enchanted like any other tool, it is not affected by the Fortune enchantment.

## Obtaining

The Pickaxe of Containment can be crafted at a [Magic Workbench](/docs/slimefun/magic-workbench).

## Usage

Breaking a vanilla spawner with a Pickaxe of Containment will produce a [Broken Spawner](/docs/slimefun/broken-spawner) with the same mob type as the original one. It can be [repaired](/docs/slimefun/reinforced-spawner) at an [Ancient Altar](/docs/slimefun/ancient-altar).
