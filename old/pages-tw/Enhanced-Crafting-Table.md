The Enhanced Crafting Table is an essential [Basic Machine](/docs/slimefun/basic-machines) in Slimefun.

It is used to craft many Slimefun items, from the most basic to the most complex.

## How to build an Enhanced Crafting Table

The recipe can be found in your Slimefun Guide. To build it, you need to place a Crafting Table on top of a Dispenser.

A complete Enhanced Crafting Table looks like this:

You can also place an [Output Chest](/docs/slimefun/output-chest) next to the Dispenser to collect your crafted items.

## How to use an Enhanced Crafting Table

Place your items in the correct pattern in the Dispenser, then right click the Crafting Table.

If the recipe is correct, the crafted item will appear in the Dispenser (or the Output Chest next to it).
